        Going into this project I had no idea how to do it and I knew it would
        be a long and hard journey to develop my project. The first challenge
        that I had to overcome in my project was the fear of not knowing what to
        do. In order to overcome this problem, I sat down and broke the project
        into small pieces that I could manage bit by bit, instead of having one
        large project to manage. For example, instead of trying to learn facial
        recognition all at once, start by learning how to find a face because
        its a small chunk of what is required, but it still contributes towards
        the project and its manageable. Once I had broken my project into small
        manageable chunks, the fear ofthe unknown was greatly reduced because I
        knew I could manage it.

        I started by preparing the hardware that I would need, mainly a
        Raspberry Pi and Pi Camera. The Pi didn't have an Operating System
        installed, so I had to work on doing that for a while, which the process
        for is explained in my how-to-guide. After the Pi was setup, I needed to
        setup the Pi Camera and test it, which is explained in the how-to-guide
        too. These were both setup without any problems, and the resources and
        support available for these are in abundance. To finish this portion of
        the project I had to find a way to stream the Pi Cam footage via HTTP,
        and after doing quite a bit of research, I found that using a
        combination of <em>raspistill</em> and VLC was the best option and it
        worked without fail. The whole Raspberry Pi related portion of the
        project was now complete, so it was now time to work on the PC related
        portion.

        The portion of the project that requires a PC to run requires a lot of
        learning, such as facial recognition and body tracking. I wanted to
        start with facial recognition because it seemed like it would take the
        longest to do. My main resource for learning facial recognition was a
        site called <a href="pyimagesearch.com">PyImageSearch</a>. This site
        provides various machine learning tutorials, mostly in Python, and it
        was quite valuable when developing my project. I followed the facial
        recognition tutorial on the site, and it didn't just show me what to do,
        but it also taught me about machine learning and how it works, which
        will help me progress in future. The changes that I made to the program
        was instead of the system recognizing the face for you, I made it return
        the raw encodings of the faces in a JSON format so users can manipulate
        it however they want. After quite a lot of problems when developing
        this, which are mentioned in the diary, I got the system to work so all
        that was left was to develop the body tracking portion.
